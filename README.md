# SearchingInChaos
My first 3D game made for a 1-week long game jam
The game is downloadable for windows only here: https://j02.itch.io/searching-in-chaos  
The entire game was made by me including the code, 3D models and their textures, sound effects, etc.

The game's main mechanic is to pick up and analyze 3D objects.

You can examine the object by using a mouse to certify whether your choice matches the criteria.
