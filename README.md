# SearchingInChaos
My first 3D game made for a 1-week long game jam
The game is downloadable for windows only here: https://j02.itch.io/searching-in-chaos  
The entire game was made by me including the code, 3D models and their textures, sound effects, etc.

The game's main mechanic is to pick up and analyze 3D objects. After picking up an object, pressing q leads to the examination interface.

You can examine the object by using a mouse to certify whether your choice matches the criteria. Once you are sure the object is in the list of objects to look for, pressing enter will check the object off the list.

The object in above gif is correct, therefore pressing enter will light the screen green and check off the corresponding object off the list.
