# SearchingInChaos
My first 3D game made for a 1-week long game jam
The game is downloadable for windows only here: https://j02.itch.io/searching-in-chaos  
The entire game was made by me including the code, 3D models and their textures, sound effects, etc.

Overall Positives:
* Good quality for a 1-week game
* 3D models look decent

Negatives:
* Difficult to understand the game even with descriptions in the comment section -> Could've added a tutorial
* Starting screen was rushed. The idea of the door itself is fine as it alerts the users that highlighted objects are interactable
* No background music
* Small bugs that could've easily been fixed, such as not blocking out the window above the table
